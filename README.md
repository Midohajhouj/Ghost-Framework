Every action in Ghost is logged, so if something goes wrong (or right!), you’ll be able to see it. We use Python’s built-in logging, and it's all pretty clear. You’ll know if something goes wrong because Ghost will tell you in your terminal. Easy peasy!
⚠️ Troubleshooting

    ADB not found: Make sure you have ADB installed and added to your system’s PATH.
    No connected devices: Is your device connected via USB or Wi-Fi with ADB debugging enabled? Check that.
    Permissions: If you’re on Linux or macOS, prepend sudo for commands that need admin permissions.
